# Ortho
Arithmetization of Ortho-Lattices

An ongoing project on the deeper connections between arithmetic combinatorial structures and the nature of quantum logic<br> constructs. Given a particular factorial design as a powerset of all lexicographically ordered bit-strings one discovers the
most vasic property of "Reverse Order" required for 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complemented_lattice">Orthomodularity</a>been inherent to the polynomial representation
of the integers themselves. The set of all such powersets arranged as a natural hierarchy of N x 2^N matrices hides certain 
important internal symmetries which are also strongly associated  with the study of <a href="http://chu.stanford.edu">Chu Spaces</a>. Such associations have also been implied for some time now in the work of 
<a href="http://boole.stanford.edu/pub/ph94.pdf">Pratt</a> as well as 
<a href="https://www.cs.ox.ac.uk/files/2372/RR-09-08.pdf">Abramsky</a>. Additionally, work with 
<a href="">Closure Spaces</a> by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diederik_Aerts">Aerts</a> points towards further association with general interconnected automata theory which points towards a positive resolution of the old 
<a href="https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Konrad_Zuse#.E2.80.9ERechnender_Raum.E2.80.9C">"Zuse-Fredkin" Conjecture</a>, recently revived by <a href="http://www.ideal-ist.eu/ps-it-89787"></a> and <a href="www.wolframscience.com/nksonline/toc.html">others</a>. The only essential difference that has not been examined by previous authors is the possibility of a purely analog implenetation
of such automata based on certain Fourier encodings as those used in the 
<a href="https://github.com/rtheo/Musarithmica">"Musarithmica"</a> project.
